URL Shortener

Design a URL shortener service that takes a valid url and returns a shortened url,
redirecting to previously provided url.

Also keep track of total visit/clicks on the url.

Routes 

POST/URL - Generates a new short URL and returns the shortened URL in the format example.com/random-id.

GET/:id - Redirects the user to the original URL

GET/URL/analytics/:id - Returns the clicks provided short id.
